## Features üåü

As Netris navigates through its _experimental_ phase, we're in the process of crafting and testing a variety of features for you:

1. **üéÆ Proton-GE Compatibility:** We utilize Proton-GE for running games, offering extensive game compatibility and ensuring you can play a wide variety of titles.

2. **‚ö° QUIC Protocol:** For input and video/audio transmission, we use QUIC via [MoQ][moq-github-url] to significantly reduce latency on variable networks, ensuring crisp visuals without sacrificing data or increasing latency.

3. **üîó Session IDs:** With a `SESSION_ID`, we seamlessly tie your game progress, achievements, and devices without the need for logging into [netris.me][website-link]. Our public CDNs, currently located in Europe (eu-north-1) and the US (us-east-1), further reduce latency for friends playing together from afar. More locations are on the way!

4. **üîÑ Automatic Game Progress Sync:** Like Stadia's state share, we automatically sync your game progress based on the *.exe file you're running, allowing you to share your progress with friends via a link.

5. **üë´ Co-op Gameplay:** Play co-op with up to 8 people, or play single player by sharing mouse and keyboard inputs seamlessly (similar to [neko][neko-url]).

6. **üåê Cross-Platform Play:** Our platform is accessible on any device that can run a Chrome-based browser, including Edge, Chrome, Brave, and Arc. And you do not have to set up anything, it's all done and maintained for you.

7. **üìä Bandwidth Optimization:** Experience hardware-accelerated `VMAF` for optimized bandwidth, ensuring the best possible video quality. [Learn More][vmaf-cuda-link]

8. **üåü ...and more:** Stay tuned as we continue to add features _sometimes inspired by platforms like Stadia_, to give you the best and most customizable gaming experience.

This platform is in an _experimental_ phase, and we're actively working on adding new features. Your feedback and support is very much appreciated.

## Getting Started üéÆ

Whether you're looking to self-host Netris or simply want to try it out without the need for your own GPU, we've got you covered. Choose the path that best suits your needs:

<!-- _You can always change your option later without losing game progress_ -->

| If you don't have a Nvidia GPU or prefer not to self-host, you can visit our website. <br/> No installation or set up required ! <br/> This is the perfect option for gamers looking to dive straight into the action without any setup. | [üëâüèΩ Get Access][website-link] |
| :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| If you're interested in self-hosting Netris, continue reading for detailed instructions on how to get started. <br/> This option is ideal if you have your own Nvidia GPU and are comfortable with setting up and managing your own server. | [Self Hosting Netrisüõ†Ô∏è](#self-hosting) |

> \[!TIP]
>
> Remember, flexibility is key with Netris. You're free to switch between self-hosting and using `netris.me` whenever you like, without losing your game progress. \~ üí°

### Self-Hosting Netris üî®

<a name="self-hosting"></a>

For those interested in self-hosting, here are is what you need to get your own Netris server up and running:

- **Nvidia GPU**: Unfortunately, this setup is exclusive to Nvidia GPUs. If you don't own one, consider renting from cloud services like AWS, GCP, or Vast.ai. We highly recommend this approach.

- **CUDA**: For GPU acceleration, CUDA version `12.0` or newer is required. Verify your CUDA installation by running `nvcc --version`.

- **Docker**: Ensure you have `docker` and `nvidia-docker` are up to date to avoid compatibility issues with CUDA. You can check your Docker version by running `docker --version` in your terminal.

- **GPU Driver**: Ensure your GPU drivers are up to date to avoid compatibility issues with CUDA. Nvidia driver version `520.56.06` or newer is required.

- **Xorg Display**: Your Nvidia GPU should not be attached to a running X display server. You can confirm this by running `nvidia-smi`.

- **Nvidia-DRM**: Make sure that the `nvidia-drm` module has been loaded and that the module is loaded with the flag `modeset=1`. Confirm this by running `sudo cat /sys/module/nvidia_drm/parameters/modeset` 

> \[!TIP]
>
> Typically, if your setup meets the necessary CUDA requirements, the `nvidia-drm` module will already be loaded, particularly in AWS G4dn instances. \~ üí°
